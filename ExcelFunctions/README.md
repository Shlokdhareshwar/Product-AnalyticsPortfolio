Excel Data Analysis and Product Analytics Project
Overview

This project was designed to simulate a real-world product analytics workflow using Microsoft Excel. It focuses on exploring user behavior, conversion trends, and performance metrics through data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The goal was to build a strong foundation in analytical thinking and Excel-based data storytelling, replicating the kind of work done by product and business analysts.
